		<h2>A Bad Website</h2>
		Below is a link to what I believe is a bad website
		<p>
    <p>
		<a href="http://www.adamandeveddb.com/">adamandeveddb.com</a>.
     
    <p>
    This website is bad because:
    
    <p>
    1. There are a whole bunch of vibrant images where each one commands attention, causing a constant shift in focus. 
    <p>
    2. Cells are so small that the front page looks dense and heavy. 

    <p>
    3. Not all of the cells are working.
    <p>
    4. There is nothing under the contact folder, making it useless.
 
    <p>
    5. The images take up to much space in the websites.
 
    <p>
    6. Little gifs play in the main page that are distracting.
 
    <p>
    7. It takes a while for the links and folders to respond.

    <p>
    8.It takes a while for the page to load. 
    <p>
    9. The overall color scheme is pretty boring and generic.

    <p>
    10. The overall placement of images, text and gifs is not consistent between different subpages.
